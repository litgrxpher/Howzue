## üîí Data Privacy

Howzue is designed to be a private sanctuary for your thoughts. All data, including your user profile and every journal entry, is stored in your browser's **local storage**. This means your data never leaves your computer.

The only exception is when you choose to use the AI-powered summary feature on the "Insights" page. This feature sends anonymized text from your recent entries to a secure cloud-based AI to generate insights.

## ü§ñ Genkit AI Integration

The application uses Firebase Genkit to power its AI features. The relevant flows are located in the `src/ai/flows` directory. These flows are responsible for:
-   Summarizing mood patterns.
-   Classifying journal entry intent.
-   Generating mood insights.

These features can be extended or modified to add more intelligent capabilities to the app.
